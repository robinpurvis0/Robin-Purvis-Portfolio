This project was done during Winter 2022. The user inputs the number of players playing and the number of cards each player gets.
The program deals random cards to each player. Each time a card is dealt, it is removed from the deck so the same card can't be dealt to two
players. When a player takes a turn, the program prints out their hand and specifies what kind of card the player must play depending on the 
card that was played last. The console clears between each turn so players can see each others hands. Players must type "ready" to start
their turn. The players continue playing according to the rules of classic UNO.

Please refer to the video "Text Based Uno Demo" for a walkthrough of the running program. 

All of the code for the program is included in the "Code" folder.
